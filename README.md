- 👋 Hi, I'll go by @WaywardDar1ing here for now
- 👀 I’m interested in coding well enough so I can properly spoil my dog
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end, some python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an app idea 
- 📫 How to reach me: flash a mirror at the sun 3 times fast and a Raven will let me know you've called. Its probably easier to let me find you.
